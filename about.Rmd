# My Current Research

I am currently a second year PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University, advised by [Dr. Chunhua Weng](https://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/). My research focus is on knowledge discovery of temporal patterns of disease with an emphasis on interpretability in clinical settings. For my most up to date publications, please see my [google scholar page here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N48rVQcAAAAJ&hl=en)
